# Music Synthesizer Project 

This coursework is a music synthesiser. Embedded software such as RTOS is utilised to make it work. Several real time tasks will need to be executed concurrently, such as detecting key presses and generating the output waveform. The keyboard is controlled using a ST NUCLEO-L432KC microcontroller module that contains a STM32L432KCU6U processor, which has an Arm Cortex-M4 core.

The inputs to the synthesiser are 12 keys (1 octave), 4 control knobs and a joystick. The outputs are 2 channels of audio and an OLED display. There is a serial port for communication with a host via USB, and a CAN bus that allows multiple modules to be stacked together to make a larger keyboard.

The following documentation provides an overview of the coursework project and mainly focusing on the implementation and analysis of the real-time system. The following sections details the features implemented, structure of the code followed by a coursework report. The report detail the tasks performed, their implementation, execution time, scheduler analysis, CPU utilization, shared data structures, and the possibility of a deadlock.

## Coursework Report

### Task Identification and Implementation

The real-time system consists of the following tasks:

- A task that samples the waveform output to a DAC (digital-to-analog converter) at a fixed frequency and sets the output voltage based on the active keys on a matrix keypad. This task also ensures that the output voltage does not clip.
- A task that reads input from the matrix keypad and updates a shared data structure that represents the state of the keys.
- A task that sends and receives messages over the CAN bus to communicate with other devices.
- A task that updates the display with information about the current state of the system.

Task 1: Description of Task 1, implemented as a thread.
Task 2: Description of Task 2, implemented as an interrupt.
Task 3: Description of Task 3, implemented as a thread.

### Task Characterisation

The following table shows the theoretical minimum initiation interval and measured maximum execution time for each task:


| Task              | Priority   | Initiation Interval ($Ï„_i$)| Execution Time  ($T_i$)|
|-------------------|------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| displayUpdateTask | 1          | 100 ms              | 16.021 ms       |                   
| scanKeysTask      | 2          | 20 ms               | 65.6 Âµs         |                   
| CAN_RX_Task       | 3          | 25.2 ms             | 30 Âµs           |                  
| CAN_TX_Task       | 3          | 60 ms               | 459 Âµs          |                   
| sampleISR         | High       | 45.5 Âµs             | 29 Âµs           |               
| CAN_RX_ISR        | High       | 0.7 ms              |  1  Âµs          |         
| CAN_TX_ISR        | High       | 0.7 ms              |  1 Âµs           |

Rate-monotonic scheduling (RMS) is used to determine the priority of tasks. It ensures an optimal CPU utilisation when shortest initiation interval task gets highest priority. 

Following the rules from RMS, interrupts generally have the highest priority because they need to respond quickly to events. In this case, the ISRs have a very short theoretical initiation interval, making them the highest priority tasks. `updateDisplayTask` has the longest interval (100 ms) and should have the lowest priority.

There are 3 noteworthy implementation details from the above table: 

Firstly, you might notice that the priority of CAN_RX_Task and CAN_TX_Task are the same. This is because for each board, it can either be transmitter or receiver. Thus, there is a maximum of 3 threads running for each board.

Secondly, CAN_RX_Task and CAN_TX_Task have a higher priority than scanKeysTask although the initiaion interval is higher. CAN_RX_Task and CAN_TX_Task has a shorter interval (25.2 ms and 60ms) than ScanKeyTask (20 ms), but they also have to execute 36 times during that interval. This means they have higher frequency of execution and thus requires a higher priority to ensure all of its instances are executed within the given interval.

Lastly, CAN_RX_Task is implemented rather than the decodeTask from the Lab2 instructions. Instead of decoding a message, we have chosen to send across the keyArray directly from the transmitter board to the receiver board. Octave information is obtained from the position of the transmitter board. The information from octave and keyArray are sufficient for our feature implementation, thus complex encoding and decoding is not required. This avoids the latency from performing decoding and resulted in a much quicker communication between boards. 


### Critical Instant Analysis

A critical instant analysis of the rate monotonic scheduler was performed, showing that all deadlines are met under worst-case conditions. The following steps were taken:

1. Consider the latency the lowest-priority task ($Ï„_n$)at the worst-case instant in time
2. Calculate the number of iterations each task has to run per highest latency 

The latentcy of lowest-priority task ($Ï„_n$) = 100ms from displayUpdateTask

| Initiation Interval ($Ï„_i$)| Execution Time  ($T_i$)|  $[\frac{Ï„_n}{Ï„_i}]$| Latency $[\frac{Ï„_n}{Ï„_i}]$($T_i$)|
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| 100 ms              | 16.021 ms       | 1            | 16.021 ms       |                  
| 20 ms              | 65.6 Âµs         |  5               | 0.328 ms       |                  
| 25.2 ms             | 30 Âµs           |  4              | 0.12 ms       |                 
| 60 ms               | 459 Âµs          | 1.6              | 0.7344 ms       |                   
| 45.5 Âµs             | 29 Âµs           | 2198              | 63.742 ms       |               
| 0.7 ms              |  1  Âµs          | 143              | 0.143 ms       |         
| 0.7 ms              |  1 Âµs           | 143              | 0.143 ms       |
|  -             |  -           | -              |      81.2314 ms  |

Total Latency = 81.2314 ms < 100ms

Since the critical instant is lower than the latency of the lowest-priority task, the scheduller will run everything on time. The analysis confirmed that all deadlines are met for the given task set under worst-case conditions.

### CPU Utilization

The total CPU utilization was quantified using the following formula for rate monotonic scheduling:

`CPU Utilization (%) = (Execution Time / Total Time) * 100`

The LCM of all tasks is found to be close to 100ms. Thus, the tasks will run at a period of 100ms.

Since the total execution time is 81.2314 ms for a period of 100ms, based on the formula above, the CPU utilisation is 81.2314%


### Shared Data Structures 

The code deploys mutexes and semaphores to guarantee safe access and synchronisation between tasks. 

These are the descriptions of Mutexes and Semaphores used: 
- `keyArrayMutex`: Mutex and Semaphore that protects the state of the matrix keypad.
- `minMaxMutex`: Mutex and Semaphore that protects the minimum and maximum values of the waveform output.
- `rotationMutex`: Mutex and Semaphore that protects the variable that controls the output voltage, using the rotation of a knob.
- `currentStepSizeMutex`: Mutex and Semaphore that protects the variable that sets the step size for sampling the waveform output. 
- `RX_MessageMutex`: Mutex and Semaphore that protects the CAN RX message queue used for receiving messages over the CAN bus.
- `CAN_TXSemaphore`: Semaphore that protects the CAN TX queue, allowing only one task to transmit data over the CAN bus at once.

### Intertask Blocking Dependencies and Deadlock Analysis 
An analysis of inter-task blocking dependencies was conducted to identify any possibility of deadlock. The system uses the following resources:

Resource 1: Description of Resource 1
Resource 2: Description of Resource 2
The tasks follow a strict order when acquiring and releasing resources, which prevents circular wait and eliminates the possibility of deadlock.
